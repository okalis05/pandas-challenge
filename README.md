# pandas-challenge
In this assignment , we are tasked with :
1-using Pandas and Jupyter Notebook, to create a report that includes a written description of at least two observable trends based on the data.

2-Perform the necessary calculations and then create a high-level snapshot of the district's key metrics in a DataFrame including the following:
    -Total number of unique schools
    -Total students
    -Total budget
    -Average math score
    -Average reading score
    -% passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)
    -% passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)
    -% overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)
  
3-Perform the necessary calculations and then create a DataFrame that summarizes key metrics about each school including the following:
    -School name
    -School type
    -Total students
    -Total school budget
    -Per student budget
    -Average math score
    -Average reading score
    -% passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)
    -% passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)
    -% overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)
    -Highest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing)

4-Sort the schools by % Overall Passing in descending order and display the top 5 rows.
Save the results in a DataFrame called "top_schools".
Lowest-Performing Schools (by % Overall Passing)

5-Sort the schools by % Overall Passing in ascending order and display the top 5 rows.
Save the results in a DataFrame called "bottom_schools".
Math Scores by Grade

6-Perform the necessary calculations to create a DataFrame that lists the average math score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.
Reading Scores by Grade

7-Create a DataFrame that lists the average reading score for students of each grade level (9th, 10th, 11th, 12th) at each school.
Scores by School Spending

8-Create a table that breaks down school performance based on average spending ranges (per student).


9-create a DataFrame called spending_summary including the following metrics:
    -Average math score
    -Average reading score
    -% passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)
    -% passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)
    -% overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)
    -Scores by School Size

10-Create a DataFrame called size_summary that breaks down school performance based on school size (small, 
medium, or large) and Scores by School Type
